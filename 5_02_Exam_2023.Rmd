# Exam 2023



```{block, type="do-something"}

**Read these instructions carefully**

This exam includes four questions that test different aspects of your learning during this course: data wrangling, data visualisation and statistics. Each question is broken down into a number sub-questions. 

Your work should be handed in as a single PDF, and the filename should include your name or username (e.g. "__BB852 Exam Owen Jones.pdf__". 
The number of each question should be clearly indicated, and the answer to each question should start on a new page.

For each question you must provide the R code you used to answer the question. The code should include comments to explain what you are doing. The code should be provided as text using a fixed-width font such as `Courier`. The rest of your answers should be in another font (e.g. Times New Roman, Cambria). Please use *text* rather than a screenshot of your code.

* Plots and tables should have appropriate captions. 
* Plots should be produced using `ggplot`.
* Remember that you can make "panels" of plots (e.g. Fig 1A, B)
* Axis labels are important. Sometimes you may want to edit them to be different from a data column name.
* Reporting of any statistics should be appropriate to the type of analysis you have done. There are examples in the course materials.
* Reporting of methods and results should be written in the style of a scientific paper (again, there are examples in the course materials).

*If you don't understand any aspects of the questions, please ask for help!*


**You MUST submit your work via itsLearning (not email!)**
