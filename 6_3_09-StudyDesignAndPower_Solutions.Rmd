## Snails on the move

Simulate a t-test-based analysis in R to figure out what sample size would result in 80% power.


```{r}
sampleSize <- 40 # vary this until power > 0.8
result <- replicate(
  1000,
  t.test(
    rnorm(sampleSize, mean = 7.4, sd = 2.76),
    rnorm(sampleSize, mean = 7.4 * 1.25, sd = 2.76)
  )$p.value
)
sum(result < 0.05) / 1000
```

You should find that you need a sample size of about 40 per group.

## Mouse lemur strength

What difference in strength could you reliably detect (with power >80%) with these sample sizes?

```{r}
diff <- 185 # Vary this to give a difference to 2nd group t-test
result <- replicate(
  1000,
  t.test(
    rnorm(25, mean = 600, sd = 145),
    rnorm(8, mean = 600 - diff, sd = 145)
  )$p.value
)
sum(result < 0.05) / 1000
```

You should find that you could detect a difference of about 185g or a mean for old animals of 415g which is 70% of the young animals i.e. a 30% reduction.
