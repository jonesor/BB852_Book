# Paths and projects

**Learning goals**

By the end of this chapter you should be able to:

- Explain the difference between absolute and relative paths.
- Use relative paths in your scripts.
- Use an RStudio Project to keep work organised.

**Prerequisites**

- You can create and save an R script in RStudio.

**A tiny motivating example**

If your project is organised, this will work on any computer:

```{r 0-05-PathsAndProjects-1, eval = FALSE}
readr::read_csv("CourseData/carnivora.csv")
```

If your project is not organised, you end up with long absolute paths that break when shared.

## File paths in plain language

A file path is the address of a file on your computer. There are two types.

### Absolute paths (full address)

These start from the root of your computer:

- Windows: `C:/Users/YourName/Documents/Project/data.csv`
- Mac: `/Users/YourName/Documents/Project/data.csv`

**Why this is a problem:** Absolute paths are different on every computer, so shared code breaks.

### Relative paths (recommended)

Relative paths start from your project folder:

```
CourseData/carnivora.csv
```

**Why this is better:** If everyone keeps the same project structure, the code just works.

## Use an RStudio Project

**What we’re about to do:** Set a predictable working directory.

An RStudio Project creates a `.Rproj` file and sets the project folder as the working directory every time you open it.

### How to create a project

1. Create a folder for the course (e.g., `BB852`).
2. In RStudio, go to `File > New Project`.
3. Choose **Existing Directory** and select your folder.
4. Click **Create Project**.

From now on, open the `.Rproj` file to work on this course. You do not need to use `setwd()` in your scripts.

**Common mistake:** Calling `setwd()` inside scripts. It works on your machine but fails for others.

**Takeaway:** RStudio Projects keep your paths stable and your work reproducible.

## Suggested folder structure

Keep your project tidy:

- `CourseData/` for data files
- `scripts/` for code
- `plots/` for exported figures
- `writing/` for notes or reports

**Try this:** Create those folders now (if they do not already exist).

---

## Key takeaways

- Relative paths make your code shareable.
- RStudio Projects fix the working directory automatically.
- A simple folder structure saves time and confusion.

## Common pitfalls recap

- Using absolute paths in scripts.
- Changing the working directory with `setwd()` and forgetting to undo it.
- Saving data and scripts in the same messy folder.

## Mini‑project

Create a new project folder with the structure above, then:

1. Put a CSV file in `CourseData/`.
2. Import it using a relative path.
3. Write one sentence explaining why the relative path is better than the absolute one.
