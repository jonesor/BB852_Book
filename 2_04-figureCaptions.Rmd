# What makes a good figure caption?

Here are some general guidelines for writing a good figure caption in a scientific paper in biology:

* Concise and descriptive: A caption should succinctly describe the main message of the figure and highlight the key results.
* Relevant information: Include relevant information such as the sample size, statistical significance, and any important details. Remember to explain what points, error bars, and any other marks represent.
* Consistent style: Ensure that the caption follows the same style as the rest of the paper, including capitalization, punctuation, and font.
* Clear and simple language: Use clear and simple language that is easily understandable by a broad audience. Avoid technical jargon and abbreviations that are not widely used.
* Referenced in text: The figure should be referenced in the text and the caption should contain a reference number.
* Scale and units: If applicable, specify the scale and units of measurement for the data presented in the figure.
* Reference in caption: If the figure refers to a specific part of the text, include a reference to that section in the caption.
* Redundant information: Avoid repeating information that is already evident in the figure, such as stating that the figure is a "Graph" or "Boxplot" or similar.


It is often good to include the actual message you are trying to convey with your plot:

**Example 1:**

A) Figure 1: Relationship between plant height (cm) and nitrogen addition (mg).

B) Figure 1: Relationship between plant height (cm) and nitrogen addition (mg), showing that as nitrogen input increases, the height of the plant also increases.

**Example 2:**

A) Figure 2: Comparison of bird species diversity in the two different habitats.

B) Figure 2: Bird species diversity is significantly higher in Habitat A compared to Habitat B.

In both examples, version B provides a clearer interpretation of the key relationship or pattern shown in the figure, compared to version A which simply states the facts. By including an interpretation of the key message, version B makes it easier for the reader to understand the significance and implications of the data presented in the figure.
